# 2048 Game
## Overview
The 2048 Game is a popular sliding tile puzzle game implemented in Java. The game is played on an m Ã— n grid (commonly a 4x4 grid), where each tile has a numerical value. The objective is to merge tiles with the same value by sliding them in specific directions until you reach the tile with the value 2048.

In this implementation, I have developed the core mechanics of the game, including tile sliding, merging of tiles, and game logic. The game features a command-line interface to interact with the player, where they can slide the tiles in any of the four possible directions: up, down, left, or right. The tiles with matching values merge to form higher-value tiles. The game continues until either the player reaches the 2048 tile or no more moves can be made.
